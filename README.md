# Overview

Inspired by my introductory programming classes.
I always wanted to have a visual way to view recursion when applied to searching algorithms, and so I built this tool for that!
Feel free to edit my code (`func_edit` is the search function) and build different graphs (`graph.data`)

# Example: Depth Search (default implementation)

# Example: Breadth-wide Search

# graph.data syntax

To create a node, type:
```
NODE NUM {...}
```
{...} are expressions like a=1 or b=0.01, which are node propreties.

To connect nodes, type:
```
ADD X Y
```
The 'arrow' points `from X to Y`. Y is dependant on X

# Enjoy!!
